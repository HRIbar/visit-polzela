The monastery in Založe was built by Count Frederick II of Celje and was gifted to Dominican monks in 1453. It was dissolved at the end of the 18th century by Emperor Joseph II. It was twice ravaged by the Turks and later rebuilt into a manor, with the surrounding area transformed into a park where various trees were planted. During World War II, many trees were cut down by the Germans, but some important ones remain. The last owner before World War II was Oto Parin. His son, Paul Parin, a doctor, surgeon, neurologist, and psychoanalyst who lived in Switzerland, published over 50 scientific papers and also wrote a literary work titled Reliable Signs of Change, which has been translated and, among other things, describes his youth at Novo Klošter and the cultural and historical significance of the manor. The manor was also the site of the first elementary school in Polzela. In 1786, a so-called trivial school was established in Novo Klošter. In 1796, the school moved to Polzela.
