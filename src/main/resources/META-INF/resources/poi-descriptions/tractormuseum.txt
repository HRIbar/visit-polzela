A unique collection of more than twenty vintage cars, gathered by the owner Ernest Obermayer from various parts of Slovenia and Austria, all of which he restored to the point where they are in full working condition. Part of the collection is a 1952 Mercedes-Benz with a wooden chassis under the metal body, of which he is particularly proud. The latest addition to the museum is a Fordson from 1919, the oldest tractor in this part of Europe. Visits must be arranged in advance by calling 03 703 32 28 or emailing tic@polzela.si.
