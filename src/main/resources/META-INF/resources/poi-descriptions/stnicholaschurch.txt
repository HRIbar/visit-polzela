The church is first mentioned in the Strasbourg visitation protocol from 1545, but its origins are older, likely dating to the second half of the 14th century. It underwent Baroque renovation during the time of Commander Baron Gloyach. In 1728, the church received its current vault, replacing the original Gothic wooden ceiling, and in the following decades, a sacristy and bell tower were added. The main altar bears the year 1783. The organ in the choir loft was brought from Gora Oljka in 1857. The bell tower was renovated in 1850, and during another renovation in 1994, it was raised by 70 cm, restoring its original shape.
