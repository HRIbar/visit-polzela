The manor and park are situated at a beautiful vantage point on the northern edge of Polzela. The history of Šenek dates back to the time of the Counts of Celje, as it was mentioned as a Žovneška estate as early as 1288. It acquired its Neo-Baroque appearance under its feudal owners, the Pongratz barons. Right next to the manor stands an interesting restored castle chapel dedicated to St. Florian, dating back to 1779.

The manor is surrounded by the Šenek Park, which has been declared a cultural monument. Today, the park features over thirty different tree species, many of which are unusual for this region. The Polzela Municipality Tourist Association has established an Educational Trail in the park, which is worth walking along in any season.

In 2022, 500 meters of walking paths were renovated and equipped with lighting, a children's playground was installed, and a small green parking area was created. The park also provides a pleasant setting for weddings (Contact: +386 3 703 32 28, tic@polzela.si).
