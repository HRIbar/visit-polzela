The military camp in Ločica ob Savinji was established at the end of the 60s of the 2nd century for the needs of the II Italian Legion, which consisted of 5,500 legionaries. Its task was to ensure the security of the Roman Empire on its eastern border. The military camp complex was designed in the shape of a regular rectangle measuring 543 x 435 meters, with walls and towers, within which the necessary infrastructure was built – roads, canals, and buildings – including the headquarters and military barracks.

The legionary camp in Ločica ob Savinji is the only well-researched Roman military camp in Slovenia. Its remains lie entirely underground. There is an information point at the site with a presentation of the camp. Guided tours must be arranged in advance by calling 03/703 32 28 or emailing tic@polzela.si.
