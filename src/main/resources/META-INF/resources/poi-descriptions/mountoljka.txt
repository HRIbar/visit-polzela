Gora Oljka (734 m) was mentioned as early as 1243 as "Križna gora" (Cross Mountain). From a contract between the owner from Šoštanj and the Order of Malta, it is evident that since at least the mid-17th century, a large cross and a chapel with statues of St. Judoc (Sv. Jošt) and St. Agnes (Sv. Neža) stood on the mountain. The present church was built between 1754 and 1757. The main altar, which ranks the church on Gora Oljka among the most impressive monuments, is notable. It is the work of sculptor Ferdinand Gallo. His sense of theatrical effects reached its peak in the Last Supper on the large altar. The row of seated apostles, life-sized, who express their emotions with vivid gestures during the Last Supper, has left the usual altar setting and seeks direct contact with the viewer. On the upper part of the altar is a painting by Fortunat Bergant, "Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane." Above it is a large cross, beneath it a statue of the Sorrowful Mother of God, with statues of St. Agnes and St. Judoc on either side. Below the church is an underground shrine with the Holy Sepulchre. The church facade and all stone parts were renovated in 1998, as well as the external lighting.

Next to the church stands a well-maintained and renovated mountain lodge with approximately 150 seats and 50 beds.
