Komenda Castle, originally called Heilenstein, sits atop a hill in Polzela and has a rich history dating back to 1149. Owned by the Sovereign Military Order of Malta for centuries, it features unique elements like a marble lion and a plaque honoring poet France Prešeren. Recently renovated, the castle now serves as a cultural hub, offering spaces for events, a library, music school, and restaurant. It showcases exhibitions on the Order of Malta, poet Neža Maurer, and artist Darinka Pavletič Lorenčak, making it a significant historical and cultural landmark in the region.
