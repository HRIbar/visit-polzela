Mešič Mill was one of the most famous mills in Polzela. On the estate, the Struga stream powered both the mill and a sawmill from 1923, and later also a dynamo for home lighting. After 1940, the mill was powered by a turbine with three sets of millstones. Before World War II, it primarily milled for locals and Polzela residents, and later for trade as well. The mill ceased operations in 1955. Mešič Mill is also notable for its architectural features, which have now been beautifully restored.
