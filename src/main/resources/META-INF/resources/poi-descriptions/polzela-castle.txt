The castle is situated on a hill in the middle of Polzela. It was first mentioned in a document from Aquileia in 1149 through its owners. From the 13th to the 18th century, it was in the hands of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. Throughout the centuries, it experienced various fates, but due to its dominant location, architectural history, and stylistic features, it represents an important cultural and historical monument. A unique feature of the castle is an ancient lion made of Pohorje marble, placed on the staircase railing at the main entrance. Above the stairs, a bronze plaque with a portrait of France Prešeren is embedded in the wall, next to which is a plaque with the inscription: "In this Komenda, between 1817 and 1819, the poet Dr. France Prešeren visited his uncle Anton Muhovec, the parish priest of Polzela."

The word Heilenstein is the German name for Polzela, which it received from its castle. The word Stein (stone) was a synonym for many castles of that time, while heil likely originates from the Old High German word hël, meaning loud or resounding. The name in its original form refers to a castle from which or about which sounds could be heard far and wide. Based on descriptions of the castle and later preserved images, the castle indeed deserved such a name. Once a strategically important building of the Polzela nobility, it passed into the hands of the Order of Malta in the 13th century for nearly half a millennium. During this time, the castle was renamed Komenda, entrusted to the administrator of the order's estates – the commander, from which the name originates. These administrators played a significant role in shaping the lives of the local people.

Since 2011, Komenda Castle has been completely renovated. The municipality has gained numerous new spaces suitable for tourism development, cultural activities, and social life. The castle offers rental spaces for conferences, seminars, meetings, and training sessions, as well as themed birthday parties for children. The entire Komenda Castle area serves as an official venue for wedding ceremonies. Within the castle premises, there are the Polzela Tourist Information Center (TIC Polzela), the Intermunicipal Public Library of Žalec – Polzela Municipal Library, a branch of the Risto Savin Music School in Žalec, and the 3POEZIJE restaurant and café. Several features attract great attention in the castle: an exhibition of artifacts from the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, a room dedicated to the poet and writer Neža Maurer with her personal belongings, and a collection of artworks by academic painter Darinka Pavletič Lorenčak.
