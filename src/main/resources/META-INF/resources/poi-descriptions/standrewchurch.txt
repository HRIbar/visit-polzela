Once a picturesque little church, first mentioned in a document from 1229, it has since become a magnificent parish church offering a scenic view of the entire area of Andraž nad Polzelo. The origins of this church are connected to the local landowners of Polzela and the Counts of Celje. Frederick I managed the Upper Carniolan Monastery, which held estates near St. Andrew and Dobrič. The Church of St. Andrew was initially a larger chapel, built in the Romanesque style. No remains or visible signs of this chapel exist today. In the second half of the 15th century, the chapel was rebuilt and expanded in the Gothic style. Remnants from this period are still visible today, with the most interesting being the Gothic stone portal, which featured two coats of arms: the Maltese cross on the right and the coat of arms of the Counts of Celje with three stars on the left. This symbol indicates that the Counts of Celje and the commanders of Polzela had patronage over the church. Since 1545, it has been mentioned as a branch of the Polzela parish. The current church includes the presbytery, nave, and two side chapels that give it the shape of a cross. It underwent major renovation in the second half of the 19th century, when new altars were installed: the main altar, two larger, and two smaller side altars. New pews and Stations of the Cross were also added.
