It is located in Dobriƒç, halfway between Podvin and Gora Oljka. It stands out from other landmarks because its base is a four-sided masonry tower. It was erected as a memorial to the plague or Black Death, which ravaged the area in the first half of the 17th century. Nearby is a depression, which according to tradition is the remnant of a collapsed pit where many locals who died from the plague were buried.
