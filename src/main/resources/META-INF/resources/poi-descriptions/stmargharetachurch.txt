The Parish Church of St. Margaret was built not far from Heilenstein Castle, in the present-day center of Polzela, and is first mentioned in 1255. The owners of Heilenstein Castle expanded their estates in connection with the estates of the Counts of Celje. The original church was Romanesque. In 1263, it became a commandery church, as evidenced by the Maltese cross relief on the ceiling in the presbytery. Over the centuries, the church was renovated several times, most significantly in 1616 when it took on its current form. The Romanesque building was baroque-ized, and the present presbytery, both chapels, and the sacristy were added; the bell tower was raised by one floor, though it retained its Gothic design.

An interesting feature of the church is the relic of St. Theodore, which was brought from Rome for the church by Commander Helfenthal. The glass coffin, in which the body of St. Theodore lay on red velvet, dressed in a precious garment decorated with gold and silver, was initially kept in the church on Gora Oljka. When a decree was issued in 1788, during the Josephine reforms, ordering the closure of the church, the relics of St. Theodore were transferred to Polzela.
