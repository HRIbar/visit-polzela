On the way to Gora Oljka, just past a plague column, stands a building that is architecturally unusual for the area. It is undoubtedly one of the oldest houses, with the year 1725 carved into its ceiling beam. The house still contains a preserved black kitchen. It is well-preserved and is a protected monument.
