The current appearance of Å tober House reflects its renovation in 1841. The year is carved into the stone portal made from green tuff. It is classified as a house type with an original black kitchen and a central Slovenian room layout. Its former social status is reflected in its richly articulated facade. The entire homestead has significant monumental value.
