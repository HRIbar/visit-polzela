Since 2007, in Andraž nad Polzelo, a permanent exhibition of the collection Humorous Clay Figurines by Miran Čobal has been on display. It humorously depicts literary characters (such as Švejk, Martin Krpan, the Butalci…) and scenes from village life (musicians, teachers, etc.) set in miniature environments with detailed features that attract the visitor's eye. Visits must be arranged in advance by calling 03 703 32 28 or emailing tic@polzela.si.
