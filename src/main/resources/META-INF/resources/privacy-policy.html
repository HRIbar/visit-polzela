  </header>

  <p>Visit Polzela ("the App") is a tourism guide application for discovering points of interest in Polzela, Slovenia. This policy explains what data the App handles, how it is used, and your choices.</p>

  <p>If you have questions, contact: <strong>UPDATE-EMAIL@example.com</strong></p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not require you to create an account.</li>
    <li>We do not collect personal information, analytics, or tracking data.</li>
    <li>Most data is processed locally on your device (e.g., language preference, cached images/assets for offline use).</li>
    <li>The App may request optional permissions (e.g., Location) to enable map-related features; your location is not stored by us.</li>
    <li>Third-party map tiles are loaded from OpenStreetMap; their servers receive typical network information (like your IP address) when tiles load.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>We do not collect, store, or share:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Names, email addresses, phone numbers, or contact information</li>
    <li>Payment information</li>
    <li>Advertising identifiers</li>
    <li>Behavioral analytics or usage analytics</li>
    <li>Device identifiers beyond what the operating system and WebView inherently process to deliver content</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Processed On Your Device</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Language preference</strong>: stored locally on your device (e.g., localStorage) so the App can remember your chosen language.</li>
    <li><strong>Offline cache</strong>: the service worker and/or app cache may store images and static assets on your device to improve performance and offline usage.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This information remains on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.</p>

  <h2>Permissions and Purpose</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Location (optional)</strong>: If you grant permission, the App may access your approximate device location to show your position on the map or to help with navigation. We do not store or share your location.</li>
    <li><strong>Network access</strong>: Required to download map tiles and content.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage (device cache)</strong>: Used to cache images and assets for offline usage. We do not access your personal files.</li>
    <li><strong>Camera/Microphone</strong>: Not used by this App.</li>
    <li><strong>Notifications</strong>: Not used by this App.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Maps and tiles are provided by OpenStreetMap (OSM) or compatible tile servers. When these tiles are requested, your device connects to those servers, which may receive your IP address and standard request metadata. For more information, see OpenStreetMap’s privacy page: <a href="https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy</a>.</p>
  <p>We do not embed analytics or advertising SDKs.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>Because we do not collect user data on our servers, there is no central database of personal data. Standard platform and WebView security are used to deliver content securely.</p>

  <h2>International Transfers</h2>
  <p>We do not operate servers for personal data collection. Map tiles and external resources may be delivered from third-party servers outside your country, subject to those providers’ policies.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to the App or legal requirements. Updates will be posted within the App (and/or at the hosted policy URL). Your continued use of the App after an update signifies acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: <strong>UPDATE-EMAIL@example.com</strong></p>
